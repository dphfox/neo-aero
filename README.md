# neo-aero
Recently I've become interested in a UI design concept I term "Neo Aero" -
modern takes on the so-called Frutiger Aero aesthetic.

These are some experiments revolving around implementing some Neo Aero styled
UI using pure CSS, to see what kind of results I can get.

This code isn't licensed right now and isn't accepting contributions - this is
just a personal sketch pad.
